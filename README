NAME
    Object::DOES - override UNIVERSAL::DOES easily

SYNOPSIS
     {
       package Test::Mock::LWP::Simple;
       use Object::DOES;
       our @DOES = qw(LWP::Simple);
       sub get { ... }
       sub head { ... }
     }
 
     foreach my $package (qw/LWP::Simple Test::Mock::LWP::Simple CGI/)
     {
       if ($package->DOES('LWP::Simple'))
       {
         say "$package does LWP::Simple";
       }
    }

DESCRIPTION
    UNIVERSAL says: *"DOES" and "isa" are similar, in that if either is
    true, you know that the object or class on which you call the method can
    perform specific behavior. However, "DOES" is different from "isa" in
    that it does not care how the invocant performs the operations, merely
    that it does. ("isa" of course mandates an inheritance relationship.
    Other relationships include aggregation, delegation, and mocking.)*

    In Perl 5.10, "UNIVERSAL::DOES" was introduced, which recognises that
    you sometimes need to indicate (and test) whether a class performs a
    particular role, but without caring if it uses inheritance to achieve
    it. (In fact, it is almost always more useful to check "DOES" than
    "isa"!)

    However, the built-in "UNIVERSAL::DOES" is essentially just a clone of
    "UNIVERSAL::isa". The intention is that if you want to indicate your
    module does a role, you must provide a custom "DOES" method for your
    package. Fair enough, but this leads to boiler-plate code along the
    lines of:

      sub DOES
      {
        my ($invocant, $role) = @_;
        return 1 if $role eq 'Foo::Version1';
        return 1 if $role eq 'Foo::Version2';
        return $invocant->SUPER::DOES($role);
      }

    But you have to be careful to get things right. At first glance the code
    above looks fine. But imagine our package also inherits from two other
    packages Bar and Baz. And imagine that Bar and Baz both provide custom
    "DOES" methods of their own. "SUPER::DOES" will only call one of those
    custom "DOES" methods.

    This module should help you avoid the headaches of considering all the
    edge cases. All you need to do is:

      use Object::DOES;
      our @DOES = qw(Role1 Role2 Role3); # etc

    There is also an alternative syntax which may be more attractive to some
    people:

      use Object::DOES -role => [qw/Role1 Role2 Role3/];
